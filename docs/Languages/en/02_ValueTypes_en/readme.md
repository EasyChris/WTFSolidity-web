# Solidity Minimalist Tutorial: 2. Value Types

Recently, I have been relearning Solidity, consolidating the finer details, and also writing a "Solidity Minimalist Tutorial" for newbies to learn. Lectures are updated 1~3 times weekly.

### Types of variables in Solidity

1. **Value Type**：This include Boolean, integer, etc. data types, which the variables of these types will always be passed by value (i.e. they are always copied when they are used as function arguments or in assignments).

2. **Reference Type**：This includes arrays and structs, which take up a large amount of storage space and pass addresses (i.e. like a pointers) directly when values are assigned.

3. **Mapping Type**: These are similar to hash tables for Solidity.

4. **Function Type**：The Solidity documentation classifies functions into numeric types, but I think they are very different from the other types mentioned, so I will classify them separately. 

Only the more commonly used value types will be introduced in this primer. The uncommon value types will not be discussed as it is not widely used. This tutorial, Tutorial 2, will introduce numeric types, while Tutorial 3 will introduce function types, and Tutorial 4 will introduce reference type and mapping type.


## Numeric type

### 1. Boolean

Boolean data type is a binary variable，either a value of `true` or `false`.

```solidity
    // Boolean
    bool public _bool = true;
```

Operators for Boolean data type include:

- !  （logical NOT）
- && （logical AND）
- || （logical OR）
- == （equality）
- != （inequality）

Code：

```solidity
    // Boolean operators
    bool public _bool1 = !_bool; // logical NOT
    bool public _bool2 = _bool && _bool1; // logical AND
    bool public _bool3 = _bool || _bool1; // logical OR
    bool public _bool4 = _bool == _bool1; // equality
    bool public _bool5 = _bool != _bool1; // inequality
```

From the above source code：the value of the variable `_bool` is `true`；so `_bool1` is not`_bool`，which yields `false`；`_bool && _bool1`'s value is `false`；`_bool || _bool1`'s value is `true`；`_bool == _bool1`'s value is `false`；and `_bool != _bool1`'s value is `true`.

**Important note：** The `&&` and `||` operator follows a short-circuit evaluation rule. This means that for an expression such as `f(x) || g(y)`，if `f(x)` is `true`，then `g(y)` will not be computed; even if its result is the opposite of `f(x)`.

### 2. Integers

Integers are the whole numbers in Solidity，most frequently used examples include:

```solidity
    // Integer
    int public _int = -1; // integers including negative numbers
    uint public _uint = 1; // positive numbers
    uint256 public _number = 20220330; // 256-bit positive integers
```
Some commonly used integer operators include:

- Inequality operator（which returns a Boolean value）： `<=`， `<`， `==`， `!=`， `>=`， `>` 
- Arithmetic operator： `+`， `-`， unary operators `-`， `+`， `*`， `/`， `%`（modulo），`**`（exponent）

Code：

```solidity
    // Integer operators
    uint256 public _number1 = _number + 1; // +，-，*，/
    uint256 public _number2 = 2**2; // Exponent
    uint256 public _number3 = 7 % 2; // Modulo (Modulus)
    bool public _numberbool = _number2 > _number3; // Great than
```

You can try running these code and see the results of these 4 variables. Correct answers get a `POAP`, maybe?

### 3. Addresses

Address type stores a 20-bit value (similar to the size of an Ethereum address). Address types also have a member variable (members of address) which serve as the basis for all contracts. There are ordinary addresses and addresses that can transfer 'ETH' ('payable'). The 'payable' address has two members, 'balance()' and 'tranfer()', making it easy to check 'ETH' balances and transfer funds.

Code:

```solidity
    // Address
    address public _address = 0x7A58c0Be72BE218B41C608b7Fe7C5bB630736C71;
    address payable public _address1 = payable(_address); // payable address (can transfer fund and check balance)
    // Members of address
    uint256 public balance = _address1.balance; // balance of address
```

The next tutorial (Tutorial 3) on function type will teach you how to use these address types.

### 4. Fixed-size byte arrays

There are two types of byte arrays (`bytes`), one is fixed of length (`byte`, `bytes8`, `bytes32`), and the other is without a fixed length. The fixed length belongs to the numeric type, and the non-fixed length type is the reference type (to be introduced in Tutorial 4). The fixed length `bytes` can store data, and consumes less `gas`.

Code：

```solidity
    // Fixed-size byte arrays
    bytes32 public _byte32 = "MiniSolidity"; 
    bytes1 public _byte = _byte32[0]; 
```

The 'MiniSolidity' value is stored in the form of bytes into the variable `_byte32`. If converted to 'hexadecimal' format the output is as follows: `0x4d696e69536f6c69646974790000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

On the other hand, the `_byte` variable stores the first byte of the `_byte32` variable, which is `0x4d`.

### 5. Enumeration

Enumeration（`enum`）is a user-defined data type within Solidity. It is mainly used to assign names to the `uint` data type, which keeps the program easy to maintain and read. It is similar to `enum` in the C language, with indexation starting at `0` for `uint` data type.

Code:

```solidity
    // Let uint 0， 1， 2 represent Buy, Hold, Sell
    enum ActionSet { Buy, Hold, Sell }
    // Create an enum variable called action
    ActionSet action = ActionSet.Buy;
```

It can be converted interchangeably to `uint` data type and checks whether the converted positive integer is within the length of the enumeration, otherwise it will report an error:
```solidity
    // Enum can be converted into uint
    function enumToUint() external view returns(uint){
        return uint(action);
    }
```

`enum` is a less popular class of variable that is hardly used by anyone. 

## Example from Remix

- After deploying the contract, you can view the specific values of each type of variable

## Summary 

In the second lecture, we introduce the 4 variable types in Solidity and explained the Boolean, integer, address, fixed-length byte array, and enumeration of numeric variables ('value type'). We will cover several other value types in the subsequent tutorials.
