# WTF Solidity Tutorial: 5. Data Storage and Scope

Recently, I have been relearning Solidity, consolidating the finer details, and also writing a "WTF Solidity Tutorial" for newbies to learn. Lectures are updated 1~3 times weekly.

## Reference types in Solidity
**Reference Type**: `array`, `struct` and `mapping`, these types take up a lot of space, and the address (similar to a pointer) is passed when assigning a value. 

Because such variables are complex and take up a lot of storage space, we need to declare the location of the data storage when using them.

## Data location
There are three types of data storage locations in solidity: `storage`, `memory` and `calldata`. Gas costs are different for different storage locations. 

The data of a `storage` variable is stored on-chain, similar to the hard disk of a computer, and consumes a lot of `gas`; while the data of `memory` and `calldata` varialbes are temporarily stored in memory, consumes less `gas`. 

General usage:

1. `storage`: The state variables are `storage` by default, which are stored on-chain. 

2. `memory`: The parameters and temporary variables in the function generally use `memory`, which is stored in memory and not on-chain. 

3. `calldata`: Similar to `memory`, stored in memory, not on-chain. The difference from `memory` is that `calldata` variables cannot be modified, and is generally used for function parameters. Example:

```solidity
    function fCalldata(uint[] calldata _x) public pure returns(uint[] calldata){
        //The parameter is the calldata array, which cannot be modified.
        // _x[0] = 0 //This modification will report an error.
        return(_x);
    }
```
**Example:**

### Data location and assignment behaviour

Data locations are not only relevant for persistency of data, but also for the semantics of assignments:

1. When `storage` (a state variable of the contract) is assigned to the local `storage` (in a function), a reference will be created, and changing the new variable will affect the original one. Example:
```solidity
    uint[] x = [1,2,3]; // state variable: array x

    function fStorage() public{
        //Declare a storage variable xStorage, pointing to x. Modifying xStorage will also affect x
        uint[] storage xStorage = x;
        xStorage[0] = 100;
    }
```
**Example:**

2. Assigning `storage` to `memory` creates independent copies, and changes to one will not affect the other; and vice versa. Example:
```solidity
    uint[] x = [1,2,3]; // state variable: array x
    
    function fMemory() public view{
        //Declare a variable xMemory of Memory, copy x. Modifying xMemory will not affect x
        uint[] memory xMemory = x;
        xMemory[0] = 100;
    }
```
**Example:**

3. Assigning `memory` to `memory` will create a reference, and changing the new variable will affect the original variable.

4. Otherwise, assigning a variable to `storage` will create independent copies, and modifying one will not affect the other.

## Variable scope
There are three types of variables in `Solidity` according to their scope, which are state variables, local variables and global variables.
### 1. State variables
State variables are variables whose data is stored on-chain and can be accessed by in-contract functions, but their `gas` consumption is high. 

State variables are declared inside the contract and outside the functions:
```solidity
contract Variables {
    uint public x = 1;
    uint public y;
    string public z;
```

We can change the value of the state variable in a function:

```solidity
    function foo() external{
        // You can change the value of the state variable in the function
        x = 5;
        y = 2;
        z = "0xAA";
    }
```

### 2. Local variable
Local variables are variables that are only valid during function execution. After the function exits, the variables are invalid. The data of local variables are stored in memory, not on-chain, and their `gas` consumption is low. 

Local variables are declared inside a function:
```solidity
    function bar() external pure returns(uint){
        uint xx = 1;
        uint yy = 3;
        uint zz = xx + yy;
        return(zz);
    }
```

### 3. Global variable
Global variables are variables that work in the global scope and are reserved keywords for `solidity`. They can be used directly in functions without declaring them:

```solidity
    function global() external view returns(address, uint, bytes memory){
        address sender = msg.sender;
        uint blockNum = block.number;
        bytes memory data = msg.data;
        return(sender, blockNum, data);
    }
```
In the above example, we use three global variables: `msg.sender`, `block.number` and `msg.data`, which represent the sender of the message (current call), current block height, and complete calldata. 

Below are some commonly used global variables:

- `blockhash(uint blockNumber)`: (`bytes32`)         The hash of the given block - only applies to the 256 most recent block. 
- `block.coinbase`             : (`address payable`) The address of the current block miner
- `block.gaslimit`             : (`uint`)            The gaslimit of the current block
- `block.number`               : (`uint`)            Current block number
- `block.timestamp`            : (`uint`)            The timestamp of the current block, in seconds since the unix epoch
- `gasleft()`                  : (`uint256`)         Remaining gas
- `msg.data`                   : (`bytes calldata`)  Complete calldata
- `msg.sender`                 : (`address payable`) Message sender (current caller)
- `msg.sig`                    : (`bytes4`)          first four bytes of the calldata (i.e. function identifier)
- `msg.value`                  : (`bytes4`)          number of wei sent with the message

## Summary
In this chapter, we introduced reference types, data storage locations and variable scopes in `solidity`. There are three types of data storage locations: `storage`, `memory` and `calldata`. Gas costs are different for different storage locations. The variable scope include state variables, local variables and global variables.
