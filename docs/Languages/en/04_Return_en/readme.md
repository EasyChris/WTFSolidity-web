# Solidity Minimalist Primer: 4. Function output (return/returns)

Recently, I have been relearning the Solidity, consolidating the finer details, and also writing a "Solidity Minimalist Primer" for newbies to learn and use from (advanced programmers can find another tutorial). Lectures are updated 1~3 times weekly.

In this section, we will introduce `Solidity` function output, including returning multiple values, named returns, and reading full and part of return values using destructuring assignments. 

## Return values(return and returns)
There are two keywords about function output: `return` and `returns`, which differ from:
- `returns` is added after the function name to declare variable type and variable name;
- `return` is used for the function body and returns specified variables.

```solidity
    // returning multiple variables
    function returnMultiple() public pure returns(uint256, bool, uint256[3] memory){
            return(1, true, [uint256(1),2,5]);
        }
```
In the above code, we stated that the `returnMultiple()` function will have multiple outputs: `returns (uint256, bool, uint256[3] memory) `, and then we determined return values in the function body with `return (1, true, [uint256 (1), 2,5]) `.

## Named returns
We can indicate the name of the return variables in `returns`, so that the `solidity` automatically initializes these variables, and automatically returns the values of these functions, without adding a `return`.

```solidity
    // named returns
    function returnNamed() public pure returns(uint256 _number, bool _bool, uint256[3] memory _array){
        _number = 2;
        _bool = false; 
        _array = [uint256(3),2,1];
    }
```
In the above code, we declare the return variable type and variable name with the `returns (uint256 _number, bool _bool, uint256[3] memory _array) `. This way, we will only need to assign values to the variable ` _ number` in the body, ` _bool ` and ` _array ` and they will automatically return.

Of course, you can also return variables with `return` in named returns:
```solidity
    // Named return, still support return
    function returnNamed2() public pure returns(uint256 _number, bool _bool, uint256[3] memory _array){
        return(1, true, [uint256(1),2,5]);
    }
```
## Destructuring assignments
`solidity` uses rules for destructuring assignments and supports the full or part of return values of the function.
- Read all return values: declare the variables to be assigned and separate them  by `, ` in order.
```solidity
        uint256 _number;
        bool _bool;
        uint256[3] memory _array;
        (_number, _bool, _array) = returnNamed();
```
- Read part of return values: declare the variables to read in return values and the variables not to read can be left out. In the following code, we only read the return value ` _bool `, but not ` _ number` and ` _array `:
```solidity
        (, _bool2, ) = returnNamed();
```
