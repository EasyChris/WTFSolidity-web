# Solidity Minimalist Primer: 10. Control flow, and Solidity Implementation of Insertion Sort

Recently, I have been relearning the Solidity, consolidating the finer details, and also writing a "Solidity Minimalist Primer" for newbies to learn and use from (advanced programmers can find another tutorial). Lectures are updated 1~3 times weekly.

In this section, we will introduce the control flow in `solidity`, and how to use `solidity` to implement Insertion Sort (`InsertionSort`),a program that looks simple but is actually bug-prone.

## Control Flow

`Solidity`'s control flow is similar to other languages, mainly including the following parts:

1. `if-else`

```solidity
function ifElseTest(uint256 _number) public pure returns(bool){
    if(_number == 0){
	return(true);
    }else{
	return(false);
    }
}
```
2. `for loop`

```solidity
function forLoopTest() public pure returns(uint256){
    uint sum = 0;
    for(uint i = 0; i < 10; i++){
	sum += i;
    }
    return(sum);
}
```
3. `while loop`

```solidity
function whileTest() public pure returns(uint256){
    uint sum = 0;
    uint i = 0;
    while(i < 10){
	sum += i;
	i++;
    }
    return(sum);
}
```
4. `do-while loop`

```solidity
function doWhileTest() public pure returns(uint256){
    uint sum = 0;
    uint i = 0;
    do{
	sum += i;
	i++;
    }while(i < 10);
    return(sum);
}
```

5. `Ternary operator`
The ternary operator is the only operator in `solidity` that accepts three operands ： a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.

```solidity
// ternary/conditional operator
function ternaryTest(uint256 x, uint256 y) public pure returns(uint256){
    // return the max of x and y
    return x >= y ? x: y; 
}
```

In addition, there are `continue` (immediately enter the next loop) and `break` (break out of the current loop) keywords can be used.

## `Solidity` Implementation of Insertion Sort

### Written up front: Over 90% of people who write the insertion algorithm with `solidity` will get it wrong.

### Insertion Sort

The problem solved by the sorting algorithm is to arrange an unordered set of numbers from small to large, such as `[2, 5, 3, 1]` to `[1, 2, 3, 5]`. 
Insertion Sort (`InsertionSort`) is the simplest sorting algorithm and the first algorithm many people learn. 
The idea of `InsertionSort` is very simple: From front to back, compare each number with the number in front of it, and if it is smaller than the number in front, switch the positions of them. 
The schematic is shown below:

### `python`Implimentation of `InsertionSort`
We may first look at the python implimentation of Insertion Sort：

```python
# Python program for implementation of Insertion Sort
def insertionSort(arr):
	for i in range(1, len(arr)):
		key = arr[i]
		j = i-1
		while j >=0 and key < arr[j] :
				arr[j+1] = arr[j]
				j -= 1
		arr[j+1] = key
```
### `BUG` shows up after rewriting to `solidity`! 
`python` implimentation of Insertion Sort can be completed in only 8 lines. 
Then we rewrite it into `solidity` code, by converting functions, variables, loops, etc. accordingly, and only need 9 lines of code:
``` solidity
    // Insertion Sort(Wrong version）
    function insertionSortWrong(uint[] memory a) public pure returns(uint[] memory) {
        
        for (uint i = 1;i < a.length;i++){
            uint temp = a[i];
            uint j=i-1;
            while( (j >= 0) && (temp < a[j])){
                a[j+1] = a[j];
                j--;
            }
            a[j+1] = temp;
        }
        return(a);
    }
```
Then we put the modified version into `remix` and run by entering `[2, 5, 3, 1]`. BOOM! There are `bugs`! 
After correcting it for a long time, I still could not find where the `bug` is. 
I went to `google` to search for "solidity insertion sort", and found that the insertion algorithm tutorials written with `solidity` on the Internet are all wrong, such as: [Sorting in Solidity without Comparison](https://medium.com/coinmonks/sorting-in-solidity-without-comparison-4eb47e04ff0d)

Remix decoded mistake output is:

### Correct Version of `Solidity InsertionSort`
After a few hours, with the help of a friend in the `Dapp-Learning` community, we finally found the problem. 
The most commonly used variable type in `solidity` is `uint`, which is a positive integer. 
If it takes a negative value, an error `underflow` will be reported. 
In the insertion algorithm, the variable `j` may get `-1`, resulting the corresponding error.

So, we just need to add 1 to `j` so that it cannot take a negative value. The correct version is:
```solidity
    // Insertion Sort（Correct Version）
    function insertionSort(uint[] memory a) public pure returns(uint[] memory) {
        // note that uint can not take negative value
        for (uint i = 1;i < a.length;i++){
            uint temp = a[i];
            uint j=i;
            while( (j >= 1) && (temp < a[j-1])){
                a[j] = a[j-1];
                j--;
            }
            a[j] = temp;
        }
        return(a);
    }
```
Result of correct code：

## Summary
In this lecture, we introduced the control flow in `solidity` and wrote Insertion Sort in `solidity`. 
`Solidity` looks simple but there are many pitfalls hidden. 
Every month, there are projects that lose tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars because of these small `Bugs`. 
Master the basics and keep practicing to write better `solidity` code.
